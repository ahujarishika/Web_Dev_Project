My hope is that these real life inspirational stories encourage you to keep going when things feel tough, to realise that there is always a way, and that if you want something, you have to fight for it.

                        <br><img src="https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTY2Njc5MTIyNzY2OTk2NTM1/nikola_tesla_napoleon-sarony-public-domain-via-wikimedia-commons.jpg" height="200" width="400">
                       <br> A short story of Nikola Tesla.
                    <br> His father was a priest, his mother, an inventor.

                    He was born during a lightning storm. he had a photographic memory. He was smart enough to memorize books, images, and even 3D structures. As a teenager, he contracted cholera. For over 9 months, he was bedridden for 9 months and had almost died. In college, he became fascinated with electricity. He moved to the US in 1884 to work for the famous inventor Thomas Edison.
                    Edison said his ideas were “splendid”, but “utterly impractical”. The company once offered him $12 million to improve his DC motor, and he did. But Edison failed to pay him, saying, “you don’t understand American humor.”
                    Instead, he offered him a raise of $10 a week. He quit working for him after this incident.
                    Edison and Tesla maintained their rivalry for years. It was called “the War of the Currents”

                    He eventually won and helped bring electricity to America. years later, he demonstrated radio transmission but a fire destroyed his lab as he prepared the first real radio signal. Marconi then took his ideas and his technology to win the Nobel Price. Tesla was inflamed, especially when he found out, Marconi had received all his financial support from his old rival Edison.
                    The court invalidated Marconi’s radio patents because they were based on Tesla’s work. Justice finally prevails, true, but unfortunately it happened two years after his death. He once didn’t even sleep and worked for continuous 84 hours. He spoke eight languages. and filled more than 300 patents. Some of his work is still classified by the U.S. Government.
                    Truthfully he never really cared about the money. Years after he died a statue of him was erected in Silicon Valley. The statue is equipped with free wi-fi connection.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Maya Angelou: who inspired Bill Clinton, JK Rowling and millions</b>
                        <br><img src="https://assets.readitforward.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/maya-angeloubirthday-1-830x625.jpg" height="200" width="400">
                        <br>Maya Angelou stopped talking for 5 years.

                        Maya’s parents divorced when she was 3 years old.
                        
                        For the next 4 years, the children lived with their grandma and their parents never visited.
                        
                        and then one day they were forced back to the city to live with their mom.
                        Months after moving in, 7-year-old Maya Angelou was abused and raped by her mother’s new boyfriend.

                        After the horrific incident, Maya confided in her brother, who told the whole family. Although the boyfriend was found guilty, he was only sentenced to one day in jail.
                        
                        Four days after his release, he was found murdered. Many suspects that Maya’s uncle had killed him.
                        
                        Shocked by what happened, Maya fell mute for the next 5 years and returned to live with her grandma.
                        During this period of silence, Maya Angelou discovered the wonderful world of literature. For years she escaped into the make-believe worlds of Shakespeare and Dickens.
                        Although very bright, Maya attended her classes in complete silence. But with support from her teachers and brother, she eventually broke her silence…

                        and found her voice once again, through dance. Maya Angelou moved to New York City to study African dance. Soon she was dancing and singing Calypso music at the hottest nightclubs.
                        
                        In the following years, she toured Europe and released her first music album, Miss Calypso.

When she heard Martin Luther King Jr. Speak, Maya was inspired to become an activist.

She raised funds for civil rights and traveled the world as a writer and radio broadcaster. She organized marches and protested with freedom fighters all over the world.

But after Dr. King’s assassination, Maya was devastated and fell into a deep depression.
So just like in her childhood, she turned to books to save her,

Except for this time, instead of reading, she started writing about her pain and her childhood.
Her first autobiography “I Know Why the Caged Birds Sings” became a best-seller and launched her career.

Maya went on to produce plays, compose music and write screenplays for TV and film, Becoming the first black woman to have a screenplay produced.
Despite never attending college, Maya received over 30 honorary degrees. She also won 3 Granny Awards for her spoken word albums.

A gifted writer, Maya’s words continue to inspire millions around the world, including Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, J.K. Rowling, and Kanye West.

Maya Angelou passed away on May, 28th, 2014. At her funeral, she was honored as the “ultimate teacher.”</p>

<p><b>Steve Irwin – Crocodiles are Easy</b>
    <br><img src="https://preview.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02847/Steve-Irwin-crocod_2847616b.jpg" height="200" width="400">
<br>An inspirational story of Steve Irwin, who spend, each day of his life till his last day, with the animals he loves. 
Steve Irwin got a 12-foot long python on his 6th birthday.
At age 9, Steve Irwin wrestled his first crocodile and fell in love with these ferocious predators. His father, Bob Irwin, was a noted conservationist, who Steve was desperate to make proud.
When fellow animal rescuer Terri Raines saw him saving crocodiles, she knew he was the one.

8 months later, the two spent their honeymoon rescuing crocodiles together. Steve and Terri turned their adventurous honeymoon into the first episode of The Crocodile Hunter, and audiences were captivated by Steve’s enthusiasm and fearless nature.
He made it known his first priority was animal welfare, and he rebelled against the typical money-hungry Hollywood stereotype.
Although many labeled him a dangerous adrenaline junkie, Steve strongly believed that loving even dangerous predators, could be the key to saving them from extinction.

According to Terri, only one thing could keep Steve away from his beloved animals, and that was the people he loved, especially his children, Bindi and Robert.

When Robert was 1 month old, footage emerged of Steve holding his infant son while feeding a 12-foot long croc.

Child and animal welfare groups alike were furious and tried to claim Steve had endangered little Robert. But according to Steve, he was in complete control of the situation, with an animal he had been around since childhood.

Steve knew his line of work was dangerous, but he believed it was a risk worth taking.
When asked when he would retire, Steve replied he would do so on the proudest day of his life, when his children dedicated themselves to wildlife conservation.

While filming a stingray, Steve was stung in the heart, and the animals lost one of their greatest champions.
He left behind a grieving family, but one with a sense of responsibility. Terri Irwin is a founding member of the Wildlife Warriors Foundation and dedicated every day of her life to Steve’s conservationist mission.
Today, Bindi and Robert, both follow in their father’s footsteps, as lovers and protectors of animals.</p>

<p><b> Paulo Coelho – “When you want something, all the universe conspires”
</b>
<br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1049667241166471168/i8pUC23c.jpg" height="200" width="400">
<br>When he was 17, his parents committed him to a mental asylum. he escaped three times. Paulo Coelho spent his 20s and 30s living life like a hippie and wandering the world aimlessly.
He set out a journey to find the deeper meaning of life. It took him on a pilgrimage to Spain.

Paulo waked for hours every day on the 500-mile road of Santiago de Compostela. He meditated and looked to gain insight into the truths of life. It was a spiritual awakening. Paulo realized it was time to follow his dream once and for all.
At nearly 40 years old, he wrote his first book. A year later, he wrote the Alchemist in only two weeks. The book flopped. Crushed but still not ready to give up. Paulo started knocking on doors begging for people to read his book. His breakthrough would mean nothing if he couldn’t share it with the world.
And then…

It happened, just like in the book.He found a publisher ready to take a chance on him. The publisher couldn’t explain why he said yes…

It was just an intuition. Today, 65 million copies of “The Alchemist” have been sold worldwide. Paulo holds the Guinness World Record for having the most translated books.

He’s impacted over 150 million people and publishes at least one novel every 2 years. Whenever Paulo travels, he continues to find beauty in the world and the people within it and has even reconciled with his parents.
Paulo Coelho connected the dots of his struggle to create his own meaning.</p>
